**Padsala** is an advanced academic planning architecture designed to synchronize study habits with cognitive biological rhythms. It acts not just as a scheduler, but as a **Cognitive Operating System** for students.

---

## 🚀 Vision
Padsala provides a "Technical Sanctuary" for students. By combining algorithmic schedule generation with a biometrics-aware focus environment, it allows students to enter a state of "Flow" and master complex subjects with surgical precision.

### **Primary Architecture: Purbanchal University**
The system is currently hard-wired for the **Purbanchal University (PoU)** academic structure, featuring a complete 8-semester syllabus database for Engineering and Technology faculties.

## ✨ v17 Features

### 1. 🧠 Adaptive Blueprint Engine
*   **Micro-Planning**: Generates 15-minute granular study blocks.
*   **Smart Status Logic**: Automatically tracks timeline progress using server-synchronized Nepal Time (UTC+5:45).
*   **Visual History**: Past days are automatically dimmed and marked as **DONE**; the current day pulses with a neon indicators.
*   **Mastery Adaptation**: Subject density automatically adjusts based on your self-reported mastery levels.

### 2. 🛡️ The Vault (Focus Galaxy)
A distraction-free "Hard Focus" environment designed to force concentration.
*   **Fullscreen Enforcement**: The system locks the interface to prevent tab-switching.
*   **Tik-Tik Audio Engine**: A subconscious rhythmic metronome (Triangle Wave) that keeps the brain in a high-alert state.
*   **Biometric Signaling**: 
    *   **5-Minute Warning**: Distinct dual-tone alarm for the "Final Push".
    *   **Session Termination**: Automated buzzer and fullscreen exit upon completion.
*   **Neural Encoding**: A mandatory reflection phase that enforces active recall before unlocking the interface.

### 3. 🪞 Mind Mirror (Analytics)
*   **Cognitive Dashboard**: Visualizes "Flow States" and "Burnout Risk".
*   **Knowledge Architecture**: Heatmap visualization of topic mastery across the entire 4-year degree.
*   **Gamification**: XP System, Streaks, and Ranks (Initiate → Grandmaster).

### 4. 🌩️ Technical Resilience
*   **PWA Ready**: Works offline and installs as a native app on mobile devices.
*   **Universal Responsiveness**: The interface fluidly adapts from 4K Desktops to Mobile Phones using a responsive grid stack.
*   **Data Persistence**:  Automatic legacy migration ensures old schedules are retroactively patched with new logic.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### **Core Stack**
*   **Backend**: Python (Flask) + SQLite (Self-Healing Schema).
*   **Frontend**: Vanilla JS (ES6+) + CSS Variables (No external frameworks).
*   **Audio**: Web Audio API (Oscillators for rhythm generation).

### **Key Modules**
*   `planner.py`: The brain. Handles dates, difficulty weighting, and status logic.
*   `db_init.py`: The memory. Seeds the comprehensive Purbanchal University syllabus.
*   `main.js`: The nervous system. Handles biometrics, timers, and UI interactions.
